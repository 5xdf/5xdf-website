    <h3>Hi ðŸ‘‹</h3>
    <p>I'm 5xdf!</p>
    <p>I am primarily a Geometry Dash YouTuber. My schedule for uploading videos is non-existant as of right now, but I
      am working on a schedule! </p>
    <p>The only type of schedule that I have is for a stream every Sunday. Streams on Sunday are Beat Saber Sunday
      streams.</p>
    <p>Enough about my unorganized schedules.</p>
    <p>If you somehow found this website randomly, and have no idea who I am and what this is even for, then all of my
      links will be in the links section on the top menu bar.</p>
    <p>OK OK OK ILL GET TO TALKING ABOUT MYSELF.</p>
    <p>As previously mentioned, I am primarily a Geometry Dash YouTuber. I also am secondaily a Beat Saber YouTuber.
      Both of these channels can be found in the links section on the top menu bar. Before being a GD YouTuber my main
      channel (@5xdf) was a channel for doing random things that I felt like posting. But now, it is a channel for
      random geometry dash things that I feel like posting. As of writing this I have 310 subscribers on my gd channel
      and 4 subscribers on my beat saber channel.</p>
